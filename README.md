# Persistent Brushing

Brushing is a basic technique of exploratory data analysis, developed in the 1970s ([Fishkeller, Friedman, and Tukey](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245345268_An_interactive_multidimensional_data_display_and_analysis_system)) and 1980s ([Becker and Cleveland](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1269768?seq=1), [Stuetzle](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2289448?seq=1)).  Over the years, products have demonstrated many ways of drawing a brush.
